Output voice CVs on 8 GPIOs (CV_PIN[x]) //"Stole" the Range-pins that are inactive on this board. Still gotta work on the formula to output exponential CVs (maybe without DAC, but low pass filtering?) instead of crazy DCO stuff. Probably won't work, so I gotta have a look at 12 bit DACs, and there are only quad channel boards in my collection, really don't want to solder SMD DAC8568s. We'll see. If it works with the RANGE voltages (simple PWM GPIO) maybe it works with CVs too. Oh man ...
A phat Sallen-Key may do the trick, see Electric Druid.
