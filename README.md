# Pico-DCO-8 - untested
My take on Craig Barnes' ingenious DUO Synth (based in PolyKit's groundbreaking Pico-DCO work) with 8 voices, but just one set of DCOs.

Fresh from VSCode, probability of "It's ALIVE!!!!": 0.00000001 %.

Pico #1: Everything EXCEPT Gates.
Pico #2: NOTHING except Gates.

Work in progress. Completely untested.
