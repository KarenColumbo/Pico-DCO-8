# Pico-DCO-8 - untested
My n00b take on Craig Barnes' ingenious DUO Synth (based on PolyKit's groundbreaking Pico-DCO work) with 8 voices, but just one set of DCOs.

Fresh from VSCode, probability of "It's ALIVE!!!!": 0.00000001 %.

Pico #1: EVERYTHING except note on/off gates.
Pico #2: NOTHING except note on/off gates.

Work in progress. Completely untested. 

It's a long shot, I know, but: help would be enormously appreciated! :)

16. 1. 2023 - Things done so far:

Board #1
- disabled Gate Pins, redistributed them to increase voice number to 8

Board #2
- disabled Reset Pins
- renamed RANGE PINS to "CV_PINS"
- added "AT_PIN" - channel aftertouch
- added "MW_PIN" - mod wheel
- placeholder comments for additional CVs and stuff
